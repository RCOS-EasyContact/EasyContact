# EasyContact

## Overview

EasyContact is an alternative web email application for Rensselaer students. We noticed that the existing roundcube interface is outdated and connecting to the site requires VPN connection. EasyContact is here to provide a modern user interface and mitigate the complexity of VPN connection with our side app, EasyAccess.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React
- Backend: Java Spring
- Packaging: Docker
